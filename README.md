# StuHeads

**Stuheads** is an innovative Android application designed to help teachers quickly assess the number of students present in a classroom by simply taking a photo. Leveraging the power of Google ML Kit, Stuheads detects and counts faces in a classroom image, providing an instant count to the teacher. This app simplifies attendance tracking and saves valuable time in large classrooms.

## Features

- **Instant Student Counting**: Detects and counts students in a classroom from a single photo.
- **Face Detection**: Utilizes Google ML Kit's face detection technology to identify and count faces in real time.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple interface designed for teachers to use quickly and effectively.
- **Data Privacy**: No personal data is stored; face data is processed only for counting and then discarded.

  
## Tech Stack

The following technologies and frameworks are used in Stuheads:

- **Kotlin**: Used for Android app development.
- **Google ML Kit**: For on-device face detection and processing.
- **XML**: Used for designing UI layouts.
